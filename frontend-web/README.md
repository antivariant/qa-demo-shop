This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing (Playwright)

Playwright runs against the QA demo stack on `http://localhost:3030`. Start the stack once, then run tests; each run only reseeds emulator data.

```bash
./dev-start.sh
cd frontend-web
npx playwright test
# or a single test
npx playwright test tests/full-scenario.spec.ts
```

Notes:
- Emulator data reset is handled by `./dev-seed.sh` in Playwright global setup.
- Stop the stack manually when done: `./dev-stop.sh`.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
